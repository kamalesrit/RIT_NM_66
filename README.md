Pizza delivery system is a web-based application which enables customers to order their pizzas online for home delivery or pick up from the pizzeria. There are a variety of food items available on this planet. Each country has its own kind of dishes to offer. But if we pick a food item which is loved by all the people on this planet, then pizza will be a clear winner in it. This SRS is made to briefly describe the requirements of the project of online pizza ordering using speaking agents. It will tell us about all the requirements for making this project. The project will be based on Web Publishing System.
